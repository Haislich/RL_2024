# RL_2024

Official Repository for the Reinforcement Learning Course at Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (Sapienza University of Rome).

Prof. Roberto Capobianco

TAs: Andrea Fanti and Federico Di Valerio

Here you will find the code used during practical lessons.

Please refer to the classroom page for further information.

## Dependencies

All the notebooks in the repository should work out-of-the-box on Google Colab. We also provide a `requirements.txt` which contains all the Python libraries needed to run the
notebooks locally, meant to be used with Python 3.8.*. To install all of them
with pip in a single command (linux/macos) run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Differences with previous years

The code of this year uses the
[gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library instead of gym, which
was used in the 2022/2023 edition of the course. A good overview of the differences can be
found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/migration-guide/).
